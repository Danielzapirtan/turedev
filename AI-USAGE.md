Commitment:

Since 20 November 2025 08:30 UTC+2 I will not use AI to generate new code any more, for my GitHub projects.
Older AI-generated code may be preserved/edited/removed etc. by me even without notice.
This note is valid to all my GitHub repos, even if I do not copy this note in all repos.
I may not document the usage of AI to generate code that occured before the above-mentioned date.
