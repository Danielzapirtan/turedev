Work shift calendar frontend web app.

The user passes to the url a user-param (5 characters) that they might recieve from Danielzapirtan.

The user-param is according to user's real shift, but it is obfuscated in the hope that they might not access other shift's calendar.

User interface is in Romanian.

The user selects from a dropdown menu a month and selects a year pressing a button and the calendar is displayed.
Light yellow means free day; green = day; blue = evening, white = day-out-of-month.

Most leftside day of week is Monday.
